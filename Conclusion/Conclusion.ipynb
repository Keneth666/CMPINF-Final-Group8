    "## Final Rubric: Neighborhood Quality of Life Potential\n",
    "\n",
    "### The relationship with Incident Levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "Public safety is one of the most immediate and influential aspects of neighborhood livability. In this project, we capture this dimension through incident levels — the total number of reported incidents, including crimes or emergencies, recorded within each neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incident levels serve as a direct indicator of neighborhood safety. A higher incident count may signal increased risks to residents, such as theft, violence, or disturbances, whereas a lower count often reflects a safer and more secure living environment. These numbers provide a data-driven basis to assess which neighborhoods may offer more peace of mind and security to their inhabitants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neighborhoods with lower incident rates tend to provide:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Safer streets and public spaces for residents and children,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Greater appeal for families, students, and long-term investment,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduced stress and anxiety related to crime or emergencies,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Higher trust in community and law enforcement presence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tracking incidents also helps city planners and policymakers identify areas that need improved public safety measures, policing strategies, and social services.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, incident levels reflect the safety and stability of a neighborhood, making them a critical factor in evaluating quality of life. A lower frequency of incidents typically corresponds with stronger community resilience, higher property values, and a more desirable place to live.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The relationship with Aggregated Income Housing:\n",
    "One of the most fundamental components of the Neighborhood Quality of Life Potential is economic vitality. In this project, we capture this dimension using aggregate household income — the total income earned by all households in a neighborhood over the past 12 months, adjusted to 2015 dollars to account for inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregate income offers a holistic view of a neighborhood’s financial landscape. Rather than focusing on individual wealth or a single household’s income, this metric reflects both the population size and economic strength of the area. A high total income implies a large number of working residents, well-paying jobs, and stronger local purchasing power. All of which contribute to more vibrant and resilient communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Economically strong neighborhoods are often equipped with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Higher quality schools, parks, and public facilities,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Well-maintained streets and services,\n",
    "\n",
    "- A robust local business environment with restaurants, shops, and job opportunities,\n",
    "\n",
    "Greater housing stability and long-term investment potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to median income, which reflects only the income of the \"middle\" household, aggregate income gives us insight into the total economic capacity of the neighborhood, which is how much wealth flows through it and what that means for residents' daily lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, aggregate household income serves as a critical sign for the resources a community has to support well-being, infrastructure, and opportunity. All are essential for a high quality of life.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The relationship with Neighborhood Traffic Infrastructure: \n",
    "\n",
    "A key indicator of neighborhood safety, navigability, and pedestrian accessibility is the presence and density of traffic signs. In this project, we assess this dimension by counting the number of traffic signs — including stop signs, pedestrian crossings, yield signs, and more — within each neighborhood’s boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total number of traffic signs offers a proxy for how well-regulated and safe a neighborhood’s transportation environment is. A higher number of traffic signs typically indicates more thoughtful urban planning and a greater emphasis on pedestrian and driver safety. It also suggests clearer traffic guidance, reduced accident risks, and a more walkable community.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neighborhoods with well-developed traffic infrastructure often benefit from:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enhanced pedestrian safety through visible and enforced crosswalks,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduced traffic-related accidents and congestion,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Better mobility for residents, including those walking, biking, or driving,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stronger adherence to traffic laws and road etiquette.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traffic signs also play a role in increasing accessibility for vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and people with disabilities. A neighborhood with robust signage helps support inclusive mobility and community flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the density of traffic signs reflects a neighborhood’s investment in public safety and urban infrastructure, making it a vital contributor to the overall quality of life and livability of the area."
