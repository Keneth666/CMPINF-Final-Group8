## Final Rubric: Neighborhood Quality of Life Potential

### The relationship with Aggregated Income Housing:
One of the most fundamental components of the Neighborhood Quality of Life Potential is economic vitality. In this project, we capture this dimension using aggregate household income — the total income earned by all households in a neighborhood over the past 12 months, adjusted to 2015 dollars to account for inflation.

Aggregate income offers a holistic view of a neighborhood’s financial landscape. Rather than focusing on individual wealth or a single household’s income, this metric reflects both the population size and economic strength of the area. A high total income implies a large number of working residents, well-paying jobs, and stronger local purchasing power — all of which contribute to more vibrant and resilient communities.

Economically strong neighborhoods are often equipped with:

- Higher quality schools, parks, and public facilities,

- Well-maintained streets and services,

- A robust local business environment with restaurants, shops, and job opportunities,

Greater housing stability and long-term investment potential.

Compared to median income, which reflects only the income of the "middle" household, aggregate income gives us insight into the total economic capacity of the neighborhood — how much wealth flows through it and what that means for residents' daily lives.

In summary, aggregate household income serves as a critical proxy for the resources a community has to support well-being, infrastructure, and opportunity — all essential for a high quality of life.
